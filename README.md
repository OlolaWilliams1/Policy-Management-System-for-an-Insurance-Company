# Policy-Management-System-for-an-Insurance-Company

An insurance company wants to create a policy management system to manage policyholders, products, and payments. The system should allow policy managers to perform various tasks, such as adding and suspending policyholders, registering new members, and managing policy products. 

Initialize the policy manager: Create an instance of PolicyManager.
Add products: Add two products using add_product.
Add policyholders: Add two policyholders using add_policy_holder.
Add payments: Add payments for each policyholder using add_payment.
Process payments: Process the payments using process_payment.
Display account details: Display the account details of the policyholders using get_policy_holder_info.
This script demonstrates the creation of policyholders, adding payments for a product, processing those payments, and displaying the policyholders' details.
